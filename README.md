### How to install and start

Make sure you have allocated minimum 6gig RAM to your docker-host.

Just adapt and run the docker-compose.yml file.
Please adapt the docker host ip.
* API_HOST=192.168.99.100

This ip will be used by the angular client, which will be available at this address.

### Option 1

Directly analyze a complete GitHub account:

```bash
curl -u admin:test -d "{\"name\": \"alexejsailer\",\"projectId\": \"myRepos\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://192.168.99.100:8090/repository-fetcher/api/v1/projects
```

That may take some time, as it will use the github api to get all clone urls for this account. It waits between each repository api call.
After you get a response you can run

```bash
curl -u admin:test -d "{\"command\": \"FETCH_PROJECT\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://192.168.99.100:8090/repository-fetcher/api/v1/commands

```

To clone all projects into the repository folder and to transfer all commits to elasticsearch for further analyse.

### Option 2

Copy git repositories you want to analyze to the repository folder. Please make sure, that your docker-host is not open to the world so that all services remain bound to a hidden network. In future I will secure the client with a password and hide all elasticsearch ports. 

You may want to group your repositories by projects:

repository->project0->r1,r2,r3

repository->project1->r1,r2,r3

Run this curl command to start fetching all commits from your repositories:

```bash
curl -u admin:test -d "{\"command\": \"FETCH\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://192.168.99.100:8090/repository-fetcher/api/v1/commands
```

After some time you should find a result, like shown by the screenshots, at 192.168.99.100.

Have fun.

Angular Client:

http://192.168.99.100

Kibana Client

http://192.168.99.100:5601

Where 192.168.99.100 is your dockerhost ip.

### Example

```bash
curl -u admin:test -d "{\"name\": \"JabRef\",\"projectId\": \"myRepos\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://192.168.99.100:8090/repository-fetcher/api/v1/projects
```

```bash
curl -u admin:test -d "{\"command\": \"FETCH_PROJECT\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://192.168.99.100:8090/repository-fetcher/api/v1/commands
```

Wait some time until it transfers all commits completely to elasticsearch.
